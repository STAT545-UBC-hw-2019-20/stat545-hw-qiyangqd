summary(mtcars)
```

# 
Make a histogram:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```


# 
Compare variables, for example: make a scatter plot of miles per gallon and car weight

```{r, mtcars, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg))  + geom_jitter()
```

# 
Find the mean of one of the variables

```{r}
mean(mtcars$mpg)
```
