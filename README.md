## Who am I?
My name is **Qi Yang**, and I am a <del>marine virus</del>. :smiling_imp:

Sorry, I am actually a first-year PhD student in Oceanography, focusing on **marine viruses** and their ecological roles in the oceans. 
Below are some marine viruses under a microscope. Super cool, aren't they?

In order to show the distribution and diversity of viruses in the sea, I am learning to use **R packages**. I hope that I can generate figures as follows by using R, which is even cooler! (Figures are from *[Christoph et al 2018](https://elifesciences.org/articles/33014)*)
