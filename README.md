# Homework Repository:bookmark: 

## What is this?
Hi! This is Qi Yang's homework repository for the course STAT 545A.

## What is this for?
This repository is used to store my assignments of STAT 545A. There will be five assignments in total, each of which will be put in its own folder. For instance, **Assignment 01** is put in a folder called **hw01**. Due dates are as follows:
- 2019-09-17 (Assignment 01)
- 2019-09-24 (Assignment 02)
- 2019-10-01 (Assignment 03)
- 2019-10-08 (Assignment 04)
- 2019-10-18 (Assignment 05)  

:smile: Some additional files are generated when I push my commits to Github. Please igore them and find my homework in its own folder.

## Who am I?
:smiling_imp: My name is **Qi Yang**, and I am a <del>marine virus</del>.

Sorry, I am actually a first-year PhD student in Oceanography, focusing on **marine viruses** and their ecological roles in the oceans. 
Below are some marine viruses under a microscope. Super cool, aren't they?

In order to show the distribution and diversity of viruses in the sea, I am going to use **R packages**, which I have just started learning. I hope that I can generate figures as follows by using R, which is even cooler!
